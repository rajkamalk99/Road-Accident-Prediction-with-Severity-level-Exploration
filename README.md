Accidents are something that are unfortunate and not predictable which leads to health risks
and property damage. Nowadays the accident rate has increased abruptly, taking the lives of
more than 1.4 million people per year. And across 20-50 million people suffer non-fatal
injuries. They occur commonly due to driver’s fault, atmospheric and road conditions,
improper traffic management system, etc. Due to the introduction of a large number of vehicles
and its varieties, one of the causes of this is over speeding. The consequences due to this are
death, injury, and property damage to victims and their families. Therefore, prediction and
accident analysis is an important topic and is also a challenge for the safety measures of the
public. Hence a tool that is able to predict the occurrence of an accident can save many lives.
It may be difficult but it isn’t impossible.



To improve road infrastructure safety management road designers, authorities, and safety
executioners need some type of prediction models. This project helps us to design such a
system that can predict the severity levels of an accident and the percentage of it’s occurrence.
The dataset used in this project consists of the cases of the USA records taken from traffic
cameras, sensors placed in road networks. Each of these records consists of a variety of
attributes like location, time, weather, period-of-day, etc. Due to a large collection of records,
we propose a new sampling technique to make the dataset shorter and more efficient to use.
This obtained data is trained using Machine learning models that produce accurate results
according to the code. This process can be carried out by a user interface which shows the
results obtained in a more elaborated manner (like percentage of prediction and its severity
level). This proposed system can then be used to improvise the safety measures and make the
driver aware of the danger and prevent catastrophes.# Road-Accident-Prediction-with-Severity-level-Exploration
